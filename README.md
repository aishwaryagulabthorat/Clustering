**Clustering Analysis: Online Retail Dataset**

**Overview**

The project utilizes the Online Retail Dataset, a transnational dataset capturing transactions from 01/12/2010 to 09/12/2011 for a UK-based non-store online retail company specializing in unique all-occasion gifts. The dataset includes transactions from both retail and wholesale customers.

**Objectives**

- Clustering Analysis: Implement K-means and hierarchical clustering algorithms to segment customers based on their purchasing behaviors.
- Customer Segmentation: Identify distinct customer groups (clusters) that exhibit similar purchasing patterns.

**Dataset**

The dataset includes attributes such as customer ID, product description, quantity purchased, and transaction date, providing rich information for clustering analysis.

**Key Components**

Code: Implementation of K-means and hierarchical clustering algorithms in Python.
Data: The Online Retail Dataset used for clustering analysis.
